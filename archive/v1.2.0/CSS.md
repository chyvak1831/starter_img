Styles orginized by **scss**, there is postCSS **autoprefixer** - so please **forgot about prefixes**.
1. **Plugins** downloads via npm, listed in file `package.json`.  
Plugins **combines into** one file `assets\css\plugins.css` by gulp, all files listed in file `assets\scss\plugins.scss`.  
In file `assets\scss\plugins.scss` you can to comment **unused bootstrap css modules**.  
2. **Custom styles** `assets\scss\theme` combines into one file `assets\css\styles.css` by gulp, all files listed in file `assets\scss\styles.scss`.  
File `assets\scss\wp_admin.scss` contain *css which loads to WordPress admin*.
3. **Critical CSS** and **preload**:
   * to avoid render-blocking CSS each `rel='stylesheet'` replaced into `rel='preload'`. As a result there is [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content) - so it's required to have *critical CSS*.
   * critical CSS generates by gulp using npm [Critical](https://www.npmjs.com/package/critical), all files listed into `config.js array criticalSrcPages`. It's require to open file `config.js` and replace each `yourdomain` into your local domain. Add more pages to `config.js array criticalSrcPages` if you need.

It's available to disable critical/preload in `Customizer->Dev functions->CSS optimization` (for example - while you're developing critical could cause problems).
